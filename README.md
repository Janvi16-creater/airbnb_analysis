# Airbnb Data Analysis Project 🏠📊

This project performs an end-to-end data analysis on Airbnb listings using Python. It explores patterns in pricing, availability, and customer preferences, and applies machine learning techniques to predict rental prices.

## 📁 Files Included

- `airbnb_analysis.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and visualizations
- `Airbnb.csv` – Raw dataset used for analysis

## 🚀 Objectives

- Analyze trends in Airbnb pricing, availability, and property features
- Identify top-performing locations and hosts
- Predict rental prices using regression models
- Provide actionable insights through clear visualizations

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Decision Tree)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights

- Found strong correlation between property type, number of reviews, and pricing
- Built predictive models with good performance to estimate price based on features
- Identified seasonal patterns and popular areas

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

- Heatmaps of feature correlation
- Price distribution by room type
- Predicted vs actual prices

## 🧠 ML Models Used

- **Linear Regression**: Baseline model
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Improved model with non-linear relationships

## 📄 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airbnb-analysis.git
   cd airbnb-analysis
   ```
2. Install required libraries (recommended to use a virtual environment):
